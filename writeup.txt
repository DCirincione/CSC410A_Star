CSC410 A-Star Write Up

Reflection on AI Tools in Software Development
For this project I implemented the A-Star search algorithm with euclidean heuristic to find the shortest path in a graph defined by a text file. While i used chatGPT to help with the outline of the code and development of certain pieces, i found the majority of the project still depended on my own understanding and decision making. The balance between AI assistance and human work gave me insight into how these tools may shape software devlopment in the future.
One strength of the AI tool was its ability to quickly generate a usable structure for the core A* loop and priority queue. Having this scaffold saved me time, since i didnt need to reinvent asic data structures or rewrite code. The tool was also helpful for suggesting a debug mode that printed g, h, and f values which gave me a clear starting point to trace the algorithm.
However, I found that much of the important functionality had to be designed and implemented by me. The AIs initial parsing code was not aligned with the asignments requirements, so I wrote my own inputing handling that built upon ChatGPT's that ignored blank lines and comments, validated alphabetic labels, and produced helpful error messages. I also created the output formatting so the results clearly matched the rubric, showing the explored order, shortest path, and total cost. Even the debug output needed refinement, I added spacing and indentation so it would be easy to read. Without my own understanding of how A* works, i would not have been able to recognize errors or confirm the heuristic and cost were applied correctly.
This highlights a truth about AI in software development. AI is excellent at speeding up the generation of standard code patterns, but they are not reliable at interpreting specific requirements or ensuring correctness in context. Human expertise is still necessary to validate outputs, adapt to asignment rubrics, and ensure user friendly format. I estimate that ChatGPT handled around 30-40% of the work, design choice, and documentation. Looking ahead, i believe AI will increase handling repetitive or standard coding tasks, while human dev's focus more on reviewing, integrating, and improving AI generated code. Jobs might shift more toward a role that focuses on specification, testing, and quality assurance rather than just raw coding. For someone like me who is still in college, this means its important not only to know how to code but also to understand algorithms deeply and to be able to evaluate what AI produces more critically.
Overall, this project showed me that AI is a powerful assistant, but not a substitute for learning or expertise. It helped me accelerate some parts of the project, but my own work determined whether the final solution was correct, clear, and aligned with the assignment requirements. This balance between AI and human judgement is likely to define software devlopment for the near future.
